SCIS Notice Board â€“ Phase 1 Documentation
1. Problem Statement
The SCIS Notice Board is a simple Java application designed for managing and
displaying official announcements at the School of Computer and Information Sciences
(SCIS), University of Hyderabad. The system enables authorized users (Admins and
Faculty) to create, edit, schedule, and archive notices. Students can view active
notices.
This application simulates the core features of a notice board without using a database,
focusing on Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
2. Use Cases Implemented
- Notice Creation: Admins and faculty can create new notices.
- Notice Viewing: Students can view all currently active notices.
- Notice Archiving: Admins can archive old notices, which are hidden from
students.
